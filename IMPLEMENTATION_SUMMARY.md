# Git Commit Reporter - Implementation Summary

## How This Project Works

The Git Commit Reporter is a TypeScript-based tool that analyzes Git repositories and generates comprehensive HTML reports for daily and weekly commit activities. Here's how it works:

### Architecture Overview

1. **Entry Point** (`src/index.ts`): Main application that orchestrates report generation
2. **Services Layer**:
   - `GitService`: Handles Git operations using simple-git library
   - `ReportService`: Generates HTML reports using Handlebars templates
3. **Reporters Layer**: Daily and weekly report generators
4. **Utilities**: Date handling, commit categorization, and formatting
5. **Templates**: Handlebars templates for HTML generation

### Key Features Implemented

#### âœ… Commit Categories Breakdown Feature

I successfully implemented the **Commit Categories Breakdown** feature as requested:

1. **Smart Categorization**: Automatically categorizes commits based on conventional commit prefixes:
   - `feat:` â†’ Feature
   - `fix:` â†’ Fix
   - `docs:` â†’ Docs
   - `refactor:` â†’ Refactor
   - `style:` â†’ Style
   - `test:` â†’ Test
   - `chore:` â†’ Chore
   - `perf:` â†’ Performance
   - Uncategorized commits â†’ Other

2. **Chart.js Integration**: Added Chart.js for beautiful doughnut charts to visualize category distribution

3. **Enhanced Reports**: Both daily and weekly reports now include:
   - Interactive category breakdown charts
   - Statistics table with percentages
   - Color-coded commit categories
   - Visual category badges on individual commits

4. **Modular Code Structure**:
   - `categorizeCommit(message: string): string` - Helper function for categorization
   - `aggregateCommitsByCategory(commits)` - Data preparation function
   - Chart rendering integrated into HTML template
   - Works for both daily and weekly reports without code duplication

#### âœ… Enhanced HTML Reports

- Beautiful responsive design with modern CSS
- Statistics cards showing total commits and categories
- Interactive Chart.js doughnut charts
- Detailed breakdown table with color coding
- **Top Contributors Leaderboard with ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥ˆðŸ¥‰ badges**
- Mobile-friendly layout

#### âœ… Comprehensive Testing

- Unit tests for categorization logic
- **Unit tests for leaderboard functionality**
- Integration tests for reporters and services
- All tests passing with proper TypeScript configuration

## Steps to Run This Project

### 1. Installation

```bash
cd /path/to/git-commit-reporter
npm install
```

### 2. Build the Project

```bash
npm run build
```

### 3. Generate Reports

```bash
npm start
```

This will generate:

- `daily-report.html` - Report for the last 24 hours
- `weekly-report.html` - Report for the last 7 days

### 4. Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### 6. Watch Mode for Tests

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Example Output

The reports now include:

1. **Header Section**: Title and date range
2. **Statistics Cards**: Total commits and category count
3. **Interactive Chart**: Doughnut chart showing category distribution
4. **Category Breakdown Table**: Detailed statistics with percentages
5. **Top Contributors Leaderboard**: Ranked table with ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥ˆðŸ¥‰ badges
6. **Commit List**: Individual commits with category badges

### Sample Input

If your commits include:

- "feat: add login API"
- "fix: resolve payment bug"
- "docs: update README"
- "refactor: optimize query"

### Sample Output

The chart will show:

- Feature: 1 (25%)
- Fix: 1 (25%)
- Docs: 1 (25%)
- Refactor: 1 (25%)

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files

- `src/utils/categories.ts` - Commit categorization logic
- `src/utils/leaderboard.ts` - **Top Contributors functionality**
- `tests/utils/categories.test.ts` - Tests for categorization
- `tests/utils/leaderboard.test.ts` - **Tests for leaderboard**
- `jest.config.js` - Jest configuration for TypeScript

### Modified Files

- `src/types/index.ts` - Added category and **leaderboard interfaces**
- `src/templates/report.hbs` - Enhanced with Chart.js integration and **leaderboard section**
- `src/services/report.ts` - Added chart data generation
- `src/reporters/daily.ts` - Integrated category analysis and **leaderboard**
- `src/reporters/weekly.ts` - Integrated category analysis and **leaderboard**
- `package.json` - Added Chart.js dependency and build scripts
- `README.md` - Updated documentation

### Dependencies Added

- `chart.js` - For creating interactive charts

The implementation is clean, modular, and follows the existing project patterns. The feature works seamlessly with both daily and weekly reports without breaking existing functionality.
